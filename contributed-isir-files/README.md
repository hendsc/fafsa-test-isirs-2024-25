## Community-contributed ISIR files

This folder contains test ISIRs that have been contributed to this repository by colleges, third-party servicers, and software vendors.

These ISIRs should be considered draft data and should not be expected to receive ongoing support. We recommend using a tool such as the lightweight [`isir-viewer.html`](/isir-viewer.html) tool to view field-level validation results for these contributed ISIRs.
* To download a file: select the file, and on the resulting page click the "Download raw file" button in the upper right menu.

You are able to submit your own test ISIRs for publishing in this repository by submitting a pull request.
Please **do not use real personally identifiable information (PII)**, as your pull request may be rejected.
Submitted test ISIRs will go through light validation and review, and may by modified before being publicly posted in this folder.

**We are unable to respond to questions about community-contributed test ISIRs that are accepted into this repository.**
